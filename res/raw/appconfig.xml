				<viewscript>Kathy: Our guest today is Ellen Williams. She's going to talk to us about the problem of pollution. Ellen, why is pollution a problem?

Ellen: Well, for one thing, pollution makes us sick.

Kathy: You mean, it's bad for our health?

Ellen: That's right. Pollution causes health problems. For example, if we breathe polluted air, we get sick.

Kathy: I see. And we also get sick if we drink polluted water.

Ellen: Yes.

Kathy: What else?

Ellen: Polluted water kills animals and fish.

Kathy: That's terrible!

Ellen: Pollution also kills plants, and plants give us clean air.

Kathy: Plants give us clean air?

Ellen: Yes. Plants and trees produce the air that we breathe. Pollution kills the plants which give us clean air.</viewscript>

				<viewscript>Kent: This is Kent Moss, the New Dynamic English Man on the Street. I'm standing outside the Natural History Museum. With me is Ella Schoeffer-Wolf, who is nine years old. Ella, tell us why you're here.

Ella: Well... I wrote a poem for a poetry contest. The contest was called "River of Words." And I won a trip to Washington, D.C.

Kent: And what was your poem about?

Ella: Fish.

Kent: Fish. Now, why did you write about fish?

Ella: Well... we had to write about something in nature, you know, like the ocean, or rain, or animals. So I chose fish, because I want people to love fish.

Kent: You want people to love fish?

Ella: Yes, because people pollute the water that fish live in, and then the fish die. I think if people love fish, then maybe they won't pollute the oceans and rivers.

Kent: I hope you're right, Ella. Well, it's been very nice talking with you. Good luck in the future!

Ella: Thank you.</viewscript>
